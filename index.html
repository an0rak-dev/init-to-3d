_When you only draw stickmen_

## ü§ô Hi, I'm Sylvain

* üåû Cloud Architect at [Artifakt](https://artifakt.io)
* üåú VR Enthusiast (worked with DirectX, WebGL, Unreal...)

Note:
‚ù§Ô∏è VR. Require 3D high Res. Want to learn.

=== 

![](./resources/images/stickman.jpg)

Note:
Max of what I can draw

===

![](./resources/images/ue5demo.jpg)

Note:
How to do this ?</section><section data-markdown="" data-separator-vertical="==="># Theory

_Wait, don't leave the room !_

# CPU vs GPU

_Two chips, two purposes_

===

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

![](./resources/images/cpu.png)

Note:
* Few cores (8-18), lots of computing power
* Max N(cores) //, just sysint for threads
* Compute operations in sequence
* Used by game loop updates, networking....

===

## GPU (Graphic Processing Unit)

![](./resources/images/gpu.png)

Note:
* Lots of cores (&gt; 1000), few computing power
* Compute operations in parallel
* Shaders, lightning, visual effects. 
* May be integrated or dedicated.

===

# Maths

_Yeah... I'm sorry_

===

## 3D means Vector

`$$ pos = \begin{bmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \\ W \end{bmatrix} $$` 

Note:
* Each point is in a 3d coords space
* Ussually : X -&gt; horizontal, Y -&gt; Vertical, Z -&gt; Depth
* W for homgenous coords, useful for operations later (often == 1)

===

### 3D means Matrix

`$$ newPos = \begin{bmatrix} X_{11} &amp; X_{12} &amp; X_{13} \\ Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; Y_{13} \\ Z_{11} &amp; Z_{12} &amp; Z_{13} \\ W_{11} &amp; W_{12} &amp; W_{13} \end{bmatrix} * \begin{bmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \\ W \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} X' \\ Y' \\ Z' \\ W' \end{bmatrix} $$`

Note:
* Each operation (translate, rotate, scale) is a different 4x4 matrix
* Each operation can be combined in 1 matrix for complete movement
* movement * vector =&gt; new position vector

===

### Referential Matters

![](./resources/images/left_hand_right_hand.png)

Note:
* Coords depend of referential
* Axis may change completly between two systems
* Choose one and stick to it !</section><section data-markdown="" data-separator-vertical="==="># Ok, now how we draw ?

_and build a new Metav..‚õî_

# 1. The Data

===

### The Object : Points

![](./resources/images/mesh.png)

Note:
* You can display Vertices using different topology
* Points

===

### The Object : Lines

![](./resources/images/mesh2.png)

Note:
* You can change the topology to connect group vertices by 2
* Lines

===

### The Object : Triangles

![](./resources/images/mesh3.png)

Note:
* You can change the topology to connect group vertices by 3
* Triangle

===

### The Object : Mesh

![](./resources/images/mesh4.png)

Note:
* When you group triangles between them
* Mesh !

===

### The Object : High Res 

![](./resources/images/mesh5.png)

Note:
* Subdivide for more precision/details
* More triangle -&gt; more work to render

===

### The MVP : Model Matrix

![](./resources/images/mvp1.png)

Note:
* Mesh's vertices had static coords
* Move each vertices of a given 4x4 matrix to move the mesh in 3d World
* Change from mesh ref to world ref

===

### The MVP : View Matrix

![](./resources/images/mvp2.png)

Note:
* Now that we know mesh position in the world, need to know where it is
* Change from world ref to camera ref
* The camera DOESN'T move, it's the world which moves

===

### The MVP : Projection Matrix

![](./resources/images/mvp3.png)

Note:
* Now that we know mesh position from camera, we need to project it to screen
* Change from camera ref to clipspace ref
* Perspective


===

# 2. The Shader Program

Note:
* First thing to use : a shader program (shader)
* Little program ran by each core of the GPU
* Must be atomic ! //ism !
* Tells the GPU how to render pixels

===

![](./resources/images/shaders_example_1.jpg)

Note:
* Shaders are everywhere in VG

===

![](./resources/images/shaders_example_2.jpg)

Note:
* Effect shader used in VFX

===

![](./resources/images/shaders_example_3.jpg)

Note:
* Several shaders may be applied to the same image

===

![](./resources/images/shaders_example_4.jpg)

Note:
* May also be used by Environment artists (fog)

===

![](./resources/images/shaders_example_5.jpg)

Note:
* Even displaying the frame use a complete, basic, shader !

===


### Vertex Shader

![](./resources/images/vertex_source.png)

Note:
* First part of the shader program
* Defines the position of each pixel in the final frame
* Movement operations / Perspectives...
* You can code it

===

### Primitive generation &amp; Rasterizer

![](./resources/images/rasterize.png)

Note:
* Calculated by the rendering engine
* Primitive generation : Use the topology setting to link the Vertices
* Rasterizer : Convert 3d object into a 2d image
* You can't code it, but settings available.

===

### Fragment Shader

![](./resources/images/fragment_source.png)

Note:
* Second part of the shader program
* Defines the color of each pixel in the final frame
* Use for color or lightning
* You can code it
