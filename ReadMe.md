## Content

The slide is organized as follow : 

1. The theory
    1. CPU vs GPU (_explaination of each and their differences_)
    2. Math Math Math (_Matrix 4dim, Left hand/right hand coords_)
    3. Geometry (_Vertices, topology, spaces: world/clip/model_)
2. Ok, how do we draw now ?
    1. The Data (Vertices/Indices, movement, MVP matrix)
    2. The Shader programs (_vertex shader, fragment shader_)
    3. The camera and its movements
3. The 3D on Web
    1. The standard (_WebGL, GLTF and the Khronos group_)
    2. The frameworks (_ThreeJS, BabylonJS_)
    3. The futur (_WebGPU_)
