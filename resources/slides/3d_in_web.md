Note:
* Natively available in all Browsers
* 2 versions available
* Compatible with OpenGL
* Use a higher level direct GPU access from the browser
* DEMO: webgl-demo

===

### GLTF

Note:
* File format to store Mesh informations
* Optimized for Web, usuable anywhere
* Data as JSON
* DEMO: gltf-demo in vscode

* Version 5 soon to release
* A very good documentation
* Support WebGL, WebXR, WebGPU...
* DEMO: file

Note:
* One of the best
* Very large community
* More low-level than BabylonJS
* DEMO: file

===
